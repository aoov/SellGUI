SellGUI is a Minecraft plugin for Spigot. 

Originally released ***4/1/2018***

Depends on the [Spigot API](https://www.spigotmc.org/) and [Vault API](https://github.com/MilkBowl/VaultAPI) for core functionality. 
Has integrations with EssentialsX for pricing. 

# About

This plugin started as a project I began working on because at the time I was running my own Minecraft server and there were no publicly available plugins that suited my need and requirements. Basing the original off [uShop](https://https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/ushop-simple-sell-all-your-items.15491/)  I was able to begin development and made it to my requirements. Shortly after I released it publicly on Spigot. 
At time of creation, I was learning as I went and made some poor decisions on the structure of the code, dataflow and overall made very messy code. There are no comments and the readability is attrocious. 

Slowly adding more features overtime, the plugin now has a long list and probably some features that were left out and undocumented.
